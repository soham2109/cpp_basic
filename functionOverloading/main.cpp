/*
Function Overload!

What if you want a function to accept an argument that can be either an int OR a double? Or what if you want some function parameters to be optional? C++ has a trick up its sleeve just for such situations.
In a process known as function overloading, you can give multiple C++ functions the same name. Just make sure at least one of these conditions is true:
    - Each has different type parameters.
    - Each has a different number of parameters.

Overloading enables you to change the way a function behaves depending on what is passed in as an argument:

void print_cat_ears(char let) {
  std::cout << " " << let << "   " << let << " " << "\n";
  std::cout << let << let << let << " " << let << let << let << "\n";
}

void print_cat_ears(int num) {
  std::cout << " " << num << "   " << num << " " << "\n";
  std::cout << num << num << num << " " << num << num << num << "\n";
}

Given the above functions, you could call the functions like so and C++ will know what to do:

print_cat_ears('A');
print_cat_ears(4);

Output:
 A   A 
AAA AAA

4   4
444 444

}
