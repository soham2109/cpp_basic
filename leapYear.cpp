/*
Write a leap_year.cpp program that:

    1. Takes a year as input.
    2. Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
    3. Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.

There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:
    1. If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, howeverâ€¦
    2. If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
    3. If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
